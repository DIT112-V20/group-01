We are going to create an application that uses User Interface(jousticks/buttons) to control the direction of the vehicle.
This way the user can, conveniently, control the vehicle and direct it to wherever they wish, as they see where the vehicle is headed towards.
we are going to use javafx to create the user interface and we are going to use java as our programming language to write the code for the app.
