We are going to create an application that uses User Interface(jousticks/buttons) to control the direction of the vehicle. in addition we want to allow the car to follow the device of the user.
This way the user can, conveniently, control the vehicle and direct it to wherever they wish, as they see where the vehicle is headed towards. The other idea is that the user is able to call their vehicle to drive to them when the vehicle is far from the user (e.g. parkedfar).
we are going to use javafx to create the user interface and we are going to use java as our programming language to write the code for the app. we are also going to use 360 servo motor, PIR motion detectors, Infrared sensors (line following), Infrared sensors (distance), ADXL337 accelerometers, ZX Gesture sensors.
